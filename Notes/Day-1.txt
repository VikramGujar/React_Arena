React 19x

Here we will study React 19 version 

We need knowladge of 
=> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

1. What is React?
=> React is a JavaScript library used to build UI for web and native applications.

2. Can we build any application using React?
=> No. It requires frameworks like
		a. Next.js
		b. Remix
		c. Gatsby 
		d. Expo (Mobile Native Apps)
 We can not build an application using only react it is just used to create user interfaces


3. What are the languages used for React?
=> JavaScript and Typescript.
   At the starting React was called as React JS because react was using only JavaScript 
   But in advance versions it is can be written in Typescript and JavaScript Both thats why 
   we call it just React now.




4. What is difference between React & Angular?
=> React is a library.
   Angular is a framework.



5. Where React is recommended?
=> If your application in Backend is enabled with lot of frameworks 
   and you want only a good UI for application, then it is recommended to use React.



6. Where Angular is used?
=> If application is using limited backend frameworks 
   and they need both front end and backend enabled with framework to control application flow, 
   then Angular is recommended. 



7. What is difference between React & React JS?
=> Both are same.  [Modern name is React]




8. Why we need technologies like Angular & React?
=> TO build 
SPA [Single page application] 
              &
PWA [Progressive web application]


9. What are the challenges in modern web development?
=> 
	a. Unified UX
	  	- Application must have same experience across all devices.
		- Mobile users also must get access to everything. 

	b. Fluid UX
		- User stays on one page and gets access to everything from the page.
		- It is a SPA [Single Page Application].

	c. Loosely Coupled & Extensible 
		- Allows to build new features outside the scope and integrate into application
		  without leading to catastrophic failures. 
        

10. What is the solution?
=>  Better build SPA & PWA.
