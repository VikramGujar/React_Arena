Routing
- Basic Route Components
- Route Parameters

                              Child Routes
- You can configure nested routes with parent and child hierarchy.
- Route container can be defined with nested routes.

Syntax:
    <Route  path="parent"  element={<ParentComponent />}>

        <Route  path="child" element={<ChildComponent} />

    </Route>

- Child Route requires an outlet, which defines the location to render target content.

Syntax:
      <ParentContainer>

            <Outlet />

     </ParentContainer>

FAQ's:
1. What is difference between Absolute & Relative path?

             http://localhost:3000/products/category/jewelery

             <Link to="/details/2" />                  => Absolute

            http://localhost:3000/details/2

          Existing Path
            http://localhost:3000/products/category/jewelery

            <Link to="details/2" />                => Relative
