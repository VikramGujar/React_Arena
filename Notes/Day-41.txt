Typescript Architecture:
1. Core Compiler    
    - core.ts            It sets up the environment for running typescript program.
    - program.ts        It checks the program structure.
    - scanner.ts        It is responsible for handling input.
    - emitter.ts        It is responsible for handling output.
    - parser.ts        It is responsible for type conversion.
    - checker.ts        It is responsible for verifying the types. [data types]

2. Standalone Compiler
    - tsc.ts             It is responsible for trans compiling the Typescript code into
                    JavaScript.

3. Language Service
    - services.ts       It is responsible for managing a business layer for typescript
                   language. It provides a library of functions and values for
                   typescript.

4. Typescript Server
    - server.ts       It is responsible for hosting your application and handling
                   request & response.
                   Typescript programs are compiled and processed on server.

5. VS Shim
    - shims.ts           It is responsible for making typescript cross platform.
                   It generates manage code.

6. Managed            It refers to the managed library.
    Language           A managed library is cross platform library.

Setup Environment for Typescript:

1. Install typescript for your PC

    C:\>npm install -g typescript

2. Check the version of types

    C:\> tsc  -v        [ latest is 5.8.2 ]

3. Create a new folder for typescript

    D:\typescript

4. Open in folder in Visual studio code


5. Open terminal and run the following commands

        > npm  init  -y            [ package.json ]
        > tsc  -init             [ tsconfig.json ]   [tslint.json - obsolete]

6. Add a new typescript file into project

         index.ts

    console.log("Welcome to TypeScript");

    > tsc  index.ts             [ generates  index.js ]
    > node index.js            [ runs index.js program]
